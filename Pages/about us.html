<p> Cassie is a PhD student in Environemntal Psychology from Ireland. She is passionate about the outdoors and enjoys nature safe clothing. She has spent her fair share of time returning clothes she should have but did't fit into.
        Now shes hoping this website will help others who just want nice comfy clothes to go and walk their dog.

    <p>Teni is a Civil Engineering undergrad but an undercover fashion nerd. She loves clothes, shoes and bags but she absolutely hates when her shopping experience doesn't turn out the way she expected- 
      so a platform that enables foresight for a customer is a gamechanger!</p>
